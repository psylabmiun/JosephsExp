Final Instructions

Thank you for taking part. To finish off, we need two things:

The HTM files in this folder give instructions on how to send the data. If you click on them they will open in your browser. Also particularly important is FinalQuestionnaire.htm, (only 8 questions) which you should fill out in your browser and send to the student researcher at jogi1800@student.miun.se 
Thank you.
