Dear Participant, 
 
Thank you for agreeing to take part in this experiment.

This document provides brief information about the experiment. 
The file Readme.PDF offers more throrough information and requires a PDF reader (such as PDFEXCHANGE or Adobe Acrobat Reader to be opened).

STARTING THE EXPERIMENT
----------------------
If you click on the SpiderExperimentVxxRxx.exe file the program will start without installing. You will therefore not have to uninstall anything from your system afterwards.

----------------------
ABOUT THE EXPERIMENT
----------------------
This experiment is part of a final project for Master Study in the course MSc Emotional Psychology at Mid-Sweden University www.miun.se. During the experiment, participants' visual reactions to various stimuli will be tested while they perform simple tasks. There are two tasks. 

- The Hard Task (involving numbers)
- The Easy Task (involving letters)

Both tasks will be accompanied by "emotional stimuli" (images of spiders and mushrooms) which are presented in the visual periphery. 
You are requested to perform the given task without looking at the emotional stimuli. 

You will also be requested to fill in two short questionnaires, one before, one after the experiment. These questionnaires will be produced automatically by the program and you will be told how to send them. 

----------------------------
PROCEDURAL SUMMARY AND TIME
----------------------------
The procedure will thus be as follows: 

1. Data protection instruction    					3 minutes
2. 1st Questionnaire (19 questions) 					5 minutes
3. Email agreement and questionnaire - check questionnaire for 
             viability and wait for a code to participate 	 	we will respond as quickly as possible
4. Enter code and calibration						2 minutes
5. Perform experiment Part 1 and Part 2					12 minutes
6. 2nd Questionnaire (8 questions)					2 minutes
7. Debrief and additional information if you request it. 		In your own time. 

The whole procedure lasts therefore around 25 minutes to half an hour (depending on calibration time) + waiting time for a code (generally between 1 hour and 24 hours).

--------------------
FURTHER INFORMATION
--------------------
More information about the experiment will be given to you during the experiment and in the Debrief after the experiment. 
If you have any further questions after the experiment or wish to offer feedback, please do not hesitate to contact the student researcher (Joseph Given) at jogi1800@student.MIUN.se. 


-----------------------------------------------------------------
DATA PROCESSING INFORMATION, DATA PROTECTION AND RIGHT TO WITHDRAW
-----------------------------------------------------------------
All questionnaire and experimental data you send will be anonymised and/or encrypted as necessary. The questionnaire data you send will be relayed through the student researcher's own website, which is run and programmed solely by the student researcher and not by any third parties (except the web space and domain provider - gmx.de). The website does not store any data you send, but simply relays through a php file directly to the student researcher per email for analysis. 
Of course, no form of data transmission in the internet is entirely secure, but the student researcher has taken every endeavour at his disposal to ascertain the security and anonymity of your data. 
This will be explained in full during the initial stages of the experiment. 
Most importantly, 
- No data will be sent unless you personally send it by clicking the button.
- You can withdraw from the experiment at any time and request the deletion of your data (including emails) without requiring to give any reason. Your request will be heeded as timely as possible. The student researcher will confirm the deletion of your data on request.



Thank you in advance for your participation.
